# ✅ Sanity is NOW CONFIGURED!

## Your Sanity Project Details:
- **Project ID**: `c24x6hh0`
- **Dataset**: `production`
- **Studio URL**: `/studio` on your site

## ⚠️ REQUIRED: Add to Vercel Now

Go to your Vercel project settings and add these environment variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=c24x6hh0
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
```

**How to add:**
1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Click your project
3. Go to Settings → Environment Variables
4. Add both variables above
5. Redeploy (Vercel will do this automatically)

## How to Use Sanity Studio:

1. **Access Studio**: Visit `https://your-site.vercel.app/studio`
2. **Login**: Use your Sanity account credentials
3. **Create Content**: 
   - Blog posts with rich text editor
   - Projects with images
   - Categories for organization
4. **Publish**: Changes are instant

## What You Can Edit in Sanity:

### Blog Posts
- Title, slug, excerpt
- Rich text content with formatting
- Images with hotspot cropping
- Categories and tags
- Publication date

### Projects
- Name and description
- Technologies used
- Links (GitHub, Demo)
- Featured status

### Authors
- Name and bio
- Avatar image
- Social links

## Current Status:

✅ **Configured locally** - Project ID is set
✅ **Studio accessible** - `/studio` route works
⚠️ **Needs Vercel env vars** - Won't work on production until you add them
✅ **Schemas ready** - Content types already defined

## To Display Sanity Content:

Currently, your site uses Supabase for blog posts. To use Sanity content instead:

1. Create content in Sanity Studio first
2. We'll need to update your components to fetch from Sanity
3. This can be done gradually (keep Supabase working while transitioning)

## Three Working Options Now:

1. **Sanity Studio** (`/studio`) - Visual editing (needs Vercel env vars)
2. **Admin Panel** (`/admin`) - Supabase blog management (working now)
3. **Direct Code** - Edit components in VS Code

## Next Step:
Add the environment variables to Vercel, then your Sanity Studio will be fully functional!
