# Vercel Build Monitoring Setup

## ‚úÖ Current Integration Status

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow
- **Location**: `.github/workflows/vercel-monitor.yml`
- **Features**:
  - Automatically comments on commits when Vercel deployment fails
  - Creates GitHub issues for failed builds
  - Runs build check on every push to main/master
  - Alerts you BEFORE code reaches Vercel if build will fail

### 2. Git Hooks (Pre-Push Protection)
- **Location**: `.husky/pre-push`
- **Features**:
  - Prevents pushing code that won't build
  - Runs `npm run build` before allowing push
  - Saves you from failed Vercel deployments

### 3. Build Status Badges
- **Location**: README.md
- **Shows**:
  - Current Vercel deployment status
  - GitHub Actions build status
  - Click badges to see detailed logs

## üîî How You'll Be Notified of Build Failures

1. **GitHub Comments**: Failed builds comment directly on the commit
2. **GitHub Issues**: Automatic issue creation with failure details
3. **Pre-Push Hook**: Local warning before code reaches GitHub
4. **Status Badges**: Visual indicators in README

## üìä Monitoring Dashboard Links

- **Vercel Dashboard**: [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
- **GitHub Actions**: [Your Repo Actions](https://github.com/JohnConnorCode/portfolio-blog/actions)
- **Deployment History**: [GitHub Deployments](https://github.com/JohnConnorCode/portfolio-blog/deployments)

## üö® What Happens When a Build Fails

1. **Local Development**:
   - Pre-push hook prevents the push
   - You see error details immediately
   - Fix locally before pushing

2. **After Push to GitHub**:
   - GitHub Action runs build check
   - Comments on commit if build fails
   - Creates issue with failure details

3. **Vercel Deployment**:
   - If deployment fails, webhook triggers
   - Comment added to commit
   - Issue created for tracking

## üõ†Ô∏è Testing the Integration

### Test Local Hook:
```bash
# Introduce a syntax error
echo "const x = {" >> src/app/page.tsx

# Try to push (should fail)
git add . && git commit -m "test" && git push

# Clean up
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

### Test GitHub Action:
```bash
# Push a commit to trigger the action
git commit --allow-empty -m "Test build monitoring"
git push
```

## üìù Manual Build Check Commands

```bash
# Quick build check
npm run build

# Full verification (with type checking)
npm run verify

# Check before pushing
npm run prepush
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### If pre-push hook isn't working:
```bash
# Reinstall husky
npx husky
chmod +x .husky/pre-push
```

### If GitHub Actions aren't running:
1. Check repository settings ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí Ensure Actions are enabled
2. Verify `.github/workflows/` directory exists
3. Check workflow file syntax at [GitHub Actions Validator](https://rhymu8354.github.io/github-actions-validator/)

### If badges show "unknown":
- Wait for first deployment/action to run
- Check repository visibility settings
- Ensure repository name in badges matches exactly
