# Secure Editor Setup

## Current Status: PARTIALLY WORKING

### ✅ What's Done:
- Password protection added to `/edit` page
- Same password as admin panel: `buildsystems`
- Authentication using session storage
- UI for editing hero and metrics

### ❌ What's NOT Working:
- **Can't save to database** - Missing settings table
- **No service role key** - Can't create table programmatically
- Changes only exist in browser memory

## To Make It Fully Work:

### Option 1: Use Existing Admin Panel (WORKS NOW)
Just use `/admin` with password `buildsystems` - this already works for blog posts.

### Option 2: Fix the Editor (Requires Supabase Access)

1. **Create Settings Table in Supabase:**
   - Go to your Supabase dashboard
   - Click SQL Editor
   - Run this SQL:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS settings (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT 1,
  content JSONB DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  CONSTRAINT single_row CHECK (id = 1)
);

-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE settings ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Allow public read
CREATE POLICY "Public read access" ON settings
  FOR SELECT USING (true);

-- Allow public update (protected by app-level auth)
CREATE POLICY "Public update" ON settings
  FOR UPDATE USING (true);
  
CREATE POLICY "Public insert" ON settings
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);

-- Insert default row
INSERT INTO settings (id, content) 
VALUES (1, '{
  "heroTitle": "JOHN CONNOR",
  "heroTagline": "Product Strategist · Growth Catalyst",
  "heroDescription": "Transforming ideas into scalable products through strategic iteration.",
  "heroHighlight": "AI-powered building. Strategic consulting. Rapid growth.",
  "metrics": [
    {"number": "$50M+", "label": "Capital Facilitated", "context": "Through strategic consulting"},
    {"number": "10,000+", "label": "Products Launched", "context": "From concept to scale"},
    {"number": "15 Years", "label": "Strategic Leadership", "context": "Consulting & product strategy"},
    {"number": "10K+", "label": "Users Impacted", "context": "Through products and platforms"}
  ]
}'::jsonb)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;
```

2. **Add Service Role Key** (optional, for better security):
   - Get from Supabase Settings > API
   - Add to `.env.local`: `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-key`

## Security Analysis:

### Current Security:
- ✅ Password required to access editor
- ✅ Session-based authentication
- ⚠️ Password is hardcoded (same as admin)
- ⚠️ No rate limiting
- ⚠️ Settings table would be publicly writable (if it existed)

### Recommended:
- Use `/admin` panel for now (fully working)
- Or set up proper authentication with Supabase Auth
- Or just edit code directly and push to GitHub

## Summary:
The editor page exists and has authentication, but can't save changes without the settings table being created in Supabase. The `/admin` panel at `/admin` (password: `buildsystems`) is fully functional for blog management.
